Because it is in the started state, it will guarantee to call {@link onStartCommand} after creating the new service instance; if there are not any pending start commands to be delivered to the service, it will be called with a null intent object, so you must take care to check for this. &lt;p&gt;This mode makes sense for things that will be explicitly started and stopped to run for arbitrary periods of time, such as a service performing background music playback." />
      <item value="Called by the system every time a client explicitly starts the service by calling {@link android.content.ContextstartService}, providing the arguments it supplied and a unique integer token representing the start request. Do not call this method directly. &lt;p&gt;For backwards compatibility, the default implementation calls {@link onStart} and returns either {@link START_STICKY} or {@link START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}. &lt;p class=&quot;caution&quot;&gt;Note that the system calls this on your service's main thread. A service's main thread is the same thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the same process. You should always avoid stalling the main thread's event loop. When doing long-running operations, network calls, or heavy disk IO, you should kick off a new thread, or use {@link android.os.AsyncTask}.&lt;p&gt; @param intent The Intent supplied to {@link android.content.ContextstartService}, as given. This may be null if the service is being restarted after its process has gone away, and it had previously returned anything except {@link START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}. @param flags Additional data about this start request. @param startId A unique integer representing this specific request to start. Use with {@link stopSelfResult(int)}. @return The return value indicates what semantics the system should use for the service's current started state. It may be one of the constants associated with the {@link START_CONTINUATION_MASK} bits. @see stopSelfResult(int)" />
